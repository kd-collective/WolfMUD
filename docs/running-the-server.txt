NAME

  server - run a WolfMUD server instance

SYNOPSIS

  server

DESCRIPTION

  Run a WolfMUD game server. It is strongly advised to create a separate user/
  group for running WolfMUD and that all files are owned by that user/group.
  As a security precaution player and data files should not be accessible to
  normal users on the system.

  server
    The name of the executable, on Windows substitute instances of server with
    server.exe

ENVIRONMENT

  WOLFMUD_DIR
    The environment variable WOLFMUD_DIR can be set to provide an alternate
    data path and/or configuration file for the server to use.

    The format of the value for WOLFMUD_DIR is [DATA_DIR][configuration_file]

    If unset WOLFMUD_DIR defaults to the equivalent of ../data/config.wrj

    DATA_DIR
      Optional relative or absolute path to the data directory. The default
      value is ../data/ i.e. data in the current path.

    configuration_file
      Optional name of a specific configuration file. The configuration file
      will be looked for in DATA_DIR. The default value is config.wrj

    As a special case WOLFMUD_DIR may be set to the special value NONE to load
    the server's default, built in configuration. This can be useful when
    testing.

  Setting WOLFMUD_DIR

    The environment variable WOLFMUD_DIR can be set using several different
    methods depending on the operating system and command shell being used.

    For Linux systems, using the Bash shell, the environment variable can be
    set for the current instance of the server by prefixing the executable:

      WOLFMUD_DIR=../data/config.wrj ./server

    The environment variable can also be set for the current Bash instance by
    exporting the variable, then starting the server:

      export WOLFMUD_DIR=../data/config.wrj
      ./server

    Shells other than Bash may behave differently and may use something other
    than the export builtin to set environment variables in the shell.

    Windows users should use the 'set' builtin to set the environment variable
    before running the server:

      set WOLFMUD_DIR=../data/config.wrj
      .\server.exe

EXAMPLES

  WOLFMUD_DIR=example.wrj
    Use the default path, ../data/, relative to the current directory as the
    DATA_DIR and the specified configuration file example.wrj

  WOLFMUD_DIR=../testdata/example.wrj
    Use the path, ../testdata/, relative to the current directory as the
    DATA_DIR and the specified configuration file example.wrj

  WOLFMUD_DIR=/home/diddymus/WolfMUD/data
    Use the absolute path /home/diddymus/WolfMUD/data as the DATA_DIR and the
    default configuration file config.wrj

  WOLFMUD_DIR=/home/diddymus/WolfMUD/data/example.wrj
    Use the absolute path /home/diddymus/WolfMUD/data as the DATA_DIR and the
    specified configuration file example.wrj

  WOLFMUD_DIR=NONE server
    Use the default, built in configuration. This is only useful for testing.

FILES

  DATA_DIR/
    Can be any path to a directory holding WolfMUD data files.

  DATA_DIR/config.wrj
    Default configuration file.

  DATA_DIR/zones/*.wrj
    Path used to locate zone files. Any files in the zones directory that end
    in .wrj will be loaded as zone files.

  DATA_DIR/players/*.wrj
    Path used to locate player account files. Any files in the players
    directory that end in .wrj will be treated as player files.
