  Compiling WolfMUD from source

DESCRIPTION

  This document describes details for compiling WolfMUD from one of the source
  code downloads.

  As a prerequisite to compiling WolfMUD you should have downloaded and
  installed Go from https://golang.org

COMPILING (LINUX)

  The following instructions assume that the WolfMUD source code download has
  been unarchived into your home directory. If a different location was used
  you should substitute ~/WolfMUD for the directory where the source code was
  unarchived.

  To compile WolfMUD for Linux first open a terminal window. Then enter the
  following:

    cd ~/WolfMUD
    go build -o bin ./...

RUNNING (LINUX)

  Once WolfMUD has been compiled the server executable will be located in the
  directory ~/WolfMUD/bin. To run the server change to the bin directory and
  start the server:

    cd ~/WolfMUD/bin
    ./server

COMPILING (WINDOWS)

  The following instructions assume that the WolfMUD source code download has
  been unarchived into the directory C:\WolfMUD. If a different location was
  used you should substitute C:\WolfMUD for the directory where the source
  code was unarchived.

  To compile WolfMUD for Windows first open a command prompt. Then enter the
  following:

    cd C:\WolfMUD
    go build -o bin ./...

RUNNING (WINDOWS)

  Once WolfMUD has been compiled the server.exe executable will be in the
  directory C:\WolfMUD\bin. To run the server change to the bin directory and
  start the server:

    cd C:\WolfMUD\bin
    .\server.exe
