WolfMUD is an open source, textual, multiplayer, network, adventure game
codebase.

Please note that WolfMUD is developed on Unix like systems. As a result all
text (.txt) and WolfMUD data files (.wrj) have Unix line endings. While these
files are plain text, programs such as Notepad, WritePad or Microsoft Office
are not suitable for editing them. Instead please use a proper text editor such
as Vim, Emacs or Notepad++ such as you would use for programming. If you just
wish to view the files you can open them in a web browser such as Google
Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Internet Explorer.

If this is your first time using WolfMUD, please read the getting-started.txt
file in the docs directory. If you are upgrading please make sure to read the
upgrading.txt file as well.
