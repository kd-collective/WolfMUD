WolfMUD is an open source, textual, multiplayer, network, adventure game
codebase.

Congratulations!

It seems that you have managed to find one of my WolfMUD experiments. As this
is an experiment things may not work as expected, or at all! Still interested
in being a guinea pig? You are? That's great! To compile and install, run the
following from the directory where you found this file:

	go build -o bin ./...

Assuming everything compiles, remember this is experimental stuff, change to
the bin directory and run the server or server.exe binary.

Documentation in the docs directory has been taken from the current WolfMUD and
may or may not be accurate depending on how many features have been implemented
so far in the experiment.

If you have any comments or suggestions: diddymus@wolfmud.org

Should your use of this experiment result in summoning small annoying imps or a
large, angry, fire breathing dragon it's obviously your own fault and I will
not be held responsible in any way...
