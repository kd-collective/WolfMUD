You are in the corner of the common room in the dragon's breath tavern. A fire
burns merrily in an ornate fireplace, giving comfort to weary travellers. The
fire causes shadows to flicker and dance around the room, changing darkness to
light and back again. To the south the common room continues and east the common
room leads to the tavern entrance.

You are on a well kept cobbled street. Buildings loom up on either side of you.
To the east the smells of a bakery taunt you. To the west the entrance to a
tavern. A sign outside the tavern proclaims it to be the "Dragon's Breath". The
street continues to the north and south.
