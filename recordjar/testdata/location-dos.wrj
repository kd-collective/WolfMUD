You are in the corner of the common room in the dragon's breath tavern. A fire
burns merrily in an ornate fireplace, giving comfort to weary travellers. The
fire causes shadows to flicker and dance around the room, changing darkness to
light and back again. To the south the common room continues and east the common
room leads to the tavern entrance.
